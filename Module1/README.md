# Module 1 â€“ Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the core concepts of authentication, roles, and access control.  
It is a simple Python script that simulates a login system with two roles (`admin` and `user`) and two protected actions.  
- **Admin role** can view admin reports.  
- **User role** can view the user profile.  
Role-based restrictions ensure that each role can only access what is intended for them.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
3. Navigate to the Module1 folder.  
4. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python RBAC_Demo.py
